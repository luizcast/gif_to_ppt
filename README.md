# git_to_ppt
The project is a python code that converts GIF files into PowerPoint presentations. 
The code takes a list of GIF files as input and saves each frame of the GIF as a separate TIFF image. 
Then, it adds each TIFF image to a separate slide in the PowerPoint presentation. 
The code saves the final presentation with the same name as the original GIF file but with a .pptx extension.
